# deoxxa's cats

These are my cats.

![Misty](IMG_0883.jpg)

This is Misty. She's small and a bit of a troublemaker.

![Sara](IMG_0838.jpg)

This is Sara. She's a good cat. Mostly sleeps and purrs.

![Baxter](IMG_0909.jpg)

This is Baxter. He's a bit younger than the other two, but is the biggest of the
lot. Good cat.
